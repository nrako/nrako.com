MDX is a super helpful markdown parser supporting JSX

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
(The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a
treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
in section 1.10.32.

> de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below
for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum
et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

```jsx
import Markdown, { meta } from './hello.mdx'
import Post, { components } from '../../components/post'

// Test comment with a line of 80 characters length to see how this fit in here?
export default () => (
  <Post meta={meta}>
    <Markdown components={components} />
  </Post>
)
```

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
desktop publishing packages and [web page](https://localhost/) editors now use
Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour
and the like).

```reasonml
type schoolPerson = Teacher | Director | Student(string);

let greeting = stranger =>
  switch (stranger) {
  | Teacher => "Hey professor!"
  | Director => "Hello director."
  | Student("Richard") => "Still here Ricky?"
  | Student(anyOtherName) => "Hey, " ++ anyOtherName ++ "."
  };
```

Run:
> $ npm run dev

Some inline `code .` in the middle of some text.

> `Test`

## Section Divider

The dominoes bellow are section dividers `<hr/>` and `* * *` in markdown.

* * *

Every second divier

Every third divider

Why dominoes? Why not, let's make up some use for these characters.
